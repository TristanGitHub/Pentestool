# Enumeration is the key 

(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

- Collect - **\*Enumeration**, more enumeration and some more enumeration.*
- Process - *Sort through data, \**analyse** and prioritisation.*
- Search - *Know what to search for and where to \**find** the exploit code.*
- Adapt - **\*Customize** the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".*
- Try - *Get ready for (lots of) \**trial and error**.*

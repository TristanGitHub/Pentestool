# NFS server exploit
This tutorial will show you how to exploit a misconfigured NFS server to gain root access to the metasploitable server. Before we start i want to explain what a NFS server is. NFS stands for Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system.

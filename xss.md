Cross-Site Scripting, or XSS, issues occur when an application uses untrusted data in a web browser without sufficient validation or escaping. If untrusted data contains a client side script, the browser will execute the script while it is interpreting the page.

Attackers can use XSS attacks to execute scripts in a victim's browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites. Anyone that can send data to the system, including administrators, are possible candidates for performing XSS attacks in an application.

According to OWASP, XSS is the most widespread vulnerability found in web applications today. This is partially due to the variety of attack vectors that are available. The easiest way of showing an XSS attack executing is using a simple alert box as a client side script pay load. To execute a XSS payload, a variety of an attack vectors may be necessary to overcome insufficient escaping or validation. The following are examples of some known attack vectors, that all create the same alert pop up that reads "XSS".

    <SCRIPT>alert('XSS')</SCRIPT>
    <IMG SRC="#" ONERROR="alert('XSS')"/>
    <INPUT TYPE="BUTTON" ONCLICK="alert('XSS')"/>
    <IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>

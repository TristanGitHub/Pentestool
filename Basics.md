## 1.  RECONNAISSANCE
Gathering preliminary data or intelligence on your target. Reconnaissance can be performed actively or passively. In this phase you learn as much as possible about the target business and how it operates. It includes identifying the target, finding out the target IP address range, network, domain name, mail server, dns records, etc..

WHOIS is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other information. The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-readable format. The WHOIS protocol is documented in RFC 3912.

## 1.  SCANNING   
Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. 

HOST DISCOVERY:
  -sL: List Scan - simply list targets to scan
  -sn: Ping Scan - disable port scan
  -Pn: Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery
  -PS/PA/PU/PY[portlist]: TCP SYN/ACK, UDP or SCTP discovery to given ports
  -PE/PP/PM: ICMP echo, timestamp, and netmask request discovery probes
  -PO[protocol list]: IP Protocol Ping
  -n/-R: Never do DNS resolution/Always resolve [default: sometimes]
  --dns-servers <serv1[,serv2],...>: Specify custom DNS servers
  --system-dns: Use OS's DNS resolver
  --traceroute: Trace hop path to each host
  
Examples standard scans

    nmap -A -T4 192.168.1.1
    nmap -A -sV -p- 192.168.1.1
    nmap -sS -v 192.168.1.1
    nmap 192.168.2.1 -O -sV -Pn -v --osscan-limit
    
How to scan with NSE scripts. You can check scripts with this command:
 
    locate *.nse

    nmap 192.168.1.1 --script default,safe -v -O -sV
    nmap -sC example.com -v
    
Checking for cross-site scripting vulnabilities:

    nmap -Pn --script=http-xssed 192.168.2.1

Checking for http vulnabilities:

    nmap -n -Pn -p 80 --open -sV -v --script http-method-tamper mijntestservers.nl
    
Checking random for vulnable web servers

    nmap -n -Pn -p 80 --open -sV -vvv --script banner,http-title -iR 100
    
Discovery scan to see if the host is active (use this if you think the standard scan is not good enough:
 
     nmap 192.168.2.1-5 -PS22-25,80,113,1050,35000 -v
    
Random DNS port scans:
     
     nmap -iR 20 -PU53 -sn -vv
     
Scan a ICMP echo, timestamp, and netmask request discovery probes:

    nmap 192.168.2.1-255 -PE -sn -v
    
Scan IP protocol list:

    nmap 192.168.2.1-255 -PO1,2,4 -sn
    
ARP scan (local network much faster)

    nmap 192.168.2.1/24 -PR -sn -vv
    
Reverse dns lookup:

    nmap 192.168.2.1-50 -sL --dns-server 192.168.2.0
    
 UDP and TCP scan:
  
    nmap 192.168.2.254 -sU -v -sS
    
 
Netdiscover is used for the active or passive scanning of those wireless networks without the DHCP server , specially when you are wardriving . However the tool can also be used for scanning hub/switched networks . This tool helps in the quick discovery of the IP addresses on a given network , even if we dont have any DHCP server .
  
     sudo netdiscover
     
Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated.

    nikto -h 192.168.1.0
    
dirsearch is a simple command line tool designed to brute force directories and files in websites.
    
    ./dirsearch.py -u 192.168.1.0 -e asd -t50

NFC server more info use:
 
    rpcinfo -p 192.168.1.0

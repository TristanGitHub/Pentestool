## 1.  RECONNAISSANCE
Gathering preliminary data or intelligence on your target. Reconnaissance can be performed actively or passively. In this phase you learn as much as possible about the target business and how it operates. It includes identifying the target, finding out the target IP address range, network, domain name, mail server, dns records, etc..

WHOIS is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block, or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other information. The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-readable format. The WHOIS protocol is documented in RFC 3912.

## 1.  SCANNING   
Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

    nmap -A -T4 192.168.1.0
    nmap -A -sV -p- 192.168.1.0
    nmap -sS 192.168.1.0

Netdiscover is used for the active or passive scanning of those wireless networks without the DHCP server , specially when you are wardriving . However the tool can also be used for scanning hub/switched networks . This tool helps in the quick discovery of the IP addresses on a given network , even if we dont have any DHCP server .
  
     sudo netdiscover
     
Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated.

    nikto -h 192.168.1.0

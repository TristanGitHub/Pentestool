This SQL code is designed to pull up the records of the specified username from its table of users. However, if the "userName" variable is crafted in a specific way by a malicious user, the SQL statement may do more than the code author intended. For example, setting the "userName" variable as:

    ' OR '1'='1

or using comments to even block the rest of the query (there are three types of SQL comments[13]). All three lines have a space at the end:

    ' OR '1'='1' --
    ' OR '1'='1' ({
    ' OR '1'='1' /*
